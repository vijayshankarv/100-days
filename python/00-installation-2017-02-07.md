# Installing python

I chose miniconda from Anaconda because it lets you easily manage environments while still being smaller than the entire Anaconda distribution. 

The instructions are available at (https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install)

Installing miniconda was easy as typing `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` in the terminal. After juggling around with the path variables in zsh, conda was good to go.
